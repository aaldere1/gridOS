# gridOS state

## Active phase

Phase 2 - Metal identity MVP

## Current status

Phase 1 is complete. The app now opens to a SwiftTerm-backed local shell through `TerminalCore`, with the backend hidden behind a narrow adapter, terminal menu commands, profile placeholders, startup-command smoke support, and passing build/tests.

## Decisions made

- Use XcodeGen for deterministic Xcode project generation.
- Start with direct Developer ID distribution as the likely production path.
- Keep App Store distribution as a later evaluation because sandboxing may constrain terminal/system features.
- Start with SwiftTerm behind an adapter once TerminalCore begins.
- Treat public plugins and custom GPU text rendering as post-stability work, not initial blockers.
- Use a conservative proprietary license posture during private alpha unless changed before public release.
- Keep `project.yml` authoritative for Xcode project structure.
- Keep SwiftTerm isolated inside `TerminalCore`; `GridOSApp` should consume `TerminalSurface`, `TerminalSessionConfiguration`, and `TerminalCommandCenter` only.

## Decisions still open

- Final public license and source availability.
- Final bundle identifier and signing team.
- Whether Intel Macs are supported after beta.
- Which LLM provider ships first.
- Whether Sparkle or another updater is used for direct distribution.

## Progress log

- 2026-05-19: Cloned repository and reviewed current planning-only state.
- 2026-05-19: Added `docs/production-roadmap.md` and linked it from `README.md`.
- 2026-05-19: Corrected `docs/vision.md` terminology from "Macros integration" to "macOS integration".
- 2026-05-19: Began Phase 0 with repo-local planning state.
- 2026-05-19: Added proprietary private-alpha license posture in `LICENSE`.
- 2026-05-19: Added XcodeGen scaffold, blank SwiftUI macOS app, framework module boundaries, initial unit tests, architecture/security/release docs, and CI skeleton.
- 2026-05-19: Generated `gridOS.xcodeproj`.
- 2026-05-19: Verified `xcodebuild -project gridOS.xcodeproj -scheme gridOS -destination 'platform=macOS' CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO build test` passed with 2 tests.
- 2026-05-19: Normalized phase directories to GSD-compatible `00-foundation` and `01-native-shell-mvp`.
- 2026-05-19: Added SwiftTerm `1.13.0` through XcodeGen/SwiftPM and embedded a real local shell in the app via `TerminalCore.TerminalSurface`.
- 2026-05-19: Added terminal command routing for copy, paste, clear, and reset.
- 2026-05-19: Added terminal profile placeholders in Settings and startup-command support for repeatable smoke verification.
- 2026-05-19: Verified `xcodebuild -quiet -project gridOS.xcodeproj -scheme gridOS -destination 'platform=macOS,arch=arm64' CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO build test` passed with 8 tests.
- 2026-05-19: Launch-smoke verified `gridOS.app` starts, creates a `-zsh` child, accepts keyboard input after window activation/click, and cleans up after `exit`.
- 2026-05-19: PTY smoke verified `vim --version`, `less --version`, `ssh -V`, `tmux -V`, `top -l 1 -n 0`, and a 1000-line fast-output burst through the app startup command path.

## Next target

Start Phase 2 Metal identity MVP:

1. Add `RenderCore` visual mode and procedural seed types.
2. Host a first Metal-backed background behind the terminal.
3. Bridge terminal activity into subtle render events without blocking PTY throughput.
4. Measure idle CPU before adding heavier effects.
